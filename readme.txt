Set up:
For this project I have created three database tables based on Income data from Census , geography information from census and complaints data from CFPS and load the data from those files into the tables.
I joined the tables as I shown below and run my different queries as I showed in word document.
I posted the results from different queries into google spreadsheets. I used google charts and javascript to show my final report in html file.
